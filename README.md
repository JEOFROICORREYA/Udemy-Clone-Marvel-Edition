 🧠Udemy Clone Marvel Edition  – Definitely *Not* a Udemy Knockoff (Just... Multiverse-Inspired)

Built a front page for a Marvel-themed course platform because the idea of Wanda teaching chaos magic and Shuri explaining Vibranium circuits was simply too powerful to ignore.

🎨 What This Actually Is

- Just the homepage.  
- No logins. No video players. No real courses.  
- Think of it as the opening credits to a movie that doesn’t exist... yet.

✨ What’s on the Page?

- Hero-style course cards with unnecessarily dramatic titles  
- Clean, responsive layout that *probably* wouldn’t get you kicked out of Wakanda  
- UI only — no backend, no databases, no S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance involved  
- More sarcasm than functionality (and that’s saying something)

🙃 Why I Made This

Because I asked myself:  
“What if Udemy met the Avengers... but only for like, five minutes and just talked about branding?”

Also, it seemed more fun than watching another tutorial on centering divs.

💡 Just So We're Clear

- This isn’t a real learning platform.  
- There’s no actual content behind those buttons.  
- But hey — at least it looks like something Vision would approve of.
